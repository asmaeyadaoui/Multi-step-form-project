# Multi Step Form With Vue JS

This is a project I worked on during my summer internship in web development, as a first year engineering student in Computer Science.
It is a multi step form for a university, used as a web marketing means to promote the university and to target potential clients.

The technology used is Vue JS.

PS : The form is in French. The english version is coming soon.
